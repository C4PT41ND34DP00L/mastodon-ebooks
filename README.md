hey look it's an ebooks bot

python3

install the requirements with `sudo pip3 install -r requirements`

make a bot (probably on bots in space) and follow the target accounts

run `python3 main.py` to login and scrape

run `pyhton3 gen.py` to make a toot

cron is an okay choice to make it toot regularly

### TODOS:
* [ ] Switch to storing model instead of original corpus.
* [ ] Move storage to a DB instead of local file system.
* [ ] Better logging (reply processor in particular).
* [ ] Get a better way to manage reply processes.
